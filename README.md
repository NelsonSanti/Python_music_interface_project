The Music Project Music Interface is a basic information management system for artists and albums without an API.
This app is open through a login system.
It aims to facilitate the recording and analysis of data related to music, allowing users to manage and consult it in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) made in Python. The system gathers information from a database created in MySQL.
