# Python Programming Language – “Music Interface” project

## Description:

The Music Project Music Interface is a basic information management system for artists and albums without an API.
This app is open through a login system.
It aims to facilitate the recording and analysis of data related to music, allowing users to manage and consult it in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) made in Python. The system gathers information from a database created in MySQL.

This project was created as part of the J+D Python Programming course and aimed to provide an opportunity to apply part of the knowledge acquired in the Python programming language. This was also the final project for one of the course modules.

## How to use?

Despite containing all these files, they are all part of an essential element that ensures the final file will function properly.
The file to be used is 'ProjetoFinalLogin_Nelson_Santiago.py'.
When running the file, a Sign-in window will appear where you must enter the access credentials for the application.
After entering these credentials, the application will start, with the graphical interface shown in the image below:
